# arcgis-toolkit-sl-wpf

This project contains the source code and libraries for the Esri ArcGIS Silverlight Toolkit SDK. The library is an extension of the ArcGIS API for Silverlight™, ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Windows Phone, and the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF™. Included are a number of controls, widgets, tools, and data sources you can use to enhance your applications. 

NOTE: This library is only an extension of the ArcGIS API for Silverlight™, ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Windows Phone, or the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for WPF™.   In order to build a complete mapping application, you will also need to install the respective products on which they are built.  See below for instructions on how to get started.
