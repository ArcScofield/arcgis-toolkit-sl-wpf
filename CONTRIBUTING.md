# Contributing to the ArcGIS Runtime SDK Toolkit for Silverlight/WPF

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Runtime SDK Toolkit for Silverlight\WPF source code.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. To add an enhancement or fix a problem, create an issue.    
    * Be descriptive.  Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce and, if possible, a sample.  If an enhancement, clearly describe the additional functionality and provide a good use case to support it.     
3. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK Toolkit for Silverlight/WPF repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-sl-wpf/) on GitHub.
4. Clone it to your local machine.
5. Checkout the [master branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-toolkit-sl-wpf/tree/master).
6. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.  The name of the branch is not important.     
7. Write code to add an enhancement or fix a problem.  
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the source code.
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.  
    * Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
8. Test your code.

### Submitting changes
1. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the "master" branch. 
3. In the pull request comments, add a reference to the issue the pull request resolves.  For example, if the pull request resolves issue 45, add a comment to the pull request that includes "#45" (no quotes).    

### Code reviews
Expect a good amount of feedback as part of any pull request.  Pull requests will be reviewed and tested, and may be rejected for various reasons, some permanent (eg breaking change, feature is out of scope), some temporary (failed code review or testing).  
 

### License
Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this repo shall be under the terms and conditions of the [Ms-PL](license.txt) license, without any additional terms or conditions.
